{"name":"HybridWebApp Framework","tagline":"A framework to make life easier when creating Hybrid WebApps with Windows Phone 8, Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1","body":"## Beyond _website in a box_\r\nThe HybridWebApp Framework allows developers to more easily create higher fidelity web/app hybrids than the \"website in a box\" approach of website hosted by a browser control. The framework makes this easy by opening up a bi-directional messaging channel between the native application and the website through a simple messaging protocol. \r\n\r\nTwo-way communication opens up more advanced integration with the host OS and as a result its significantly easier to be creative, for example:\r\n* Dynamically replace the websites navigational structure with a native app structure\r\n* Pin interesting content via secondary tile (ie: recipe, album, tv series, etc)\r\n* Interact with OS features such as the [System Media Transport Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrols.aspx) \r\n* Manipulate the DOM to add new buttons into the website that perform actions in the host app\r\n* Delegate Facebook Login to OS native UI (ie: [WebAuthenticationBroker](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.security.authentication.web.webauthenticationbroker.aspx))\r\n\r\nFind out how to get started using the project over at the wiki: https://github.com/craigomatic/HybridWebApp-Framework/wiki\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthored by @craigomatic\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
